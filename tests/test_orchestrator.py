"""End-to-end multi-agent (orchestrator) tests — require an LLM API key.

Runs the multi_hop offline_sample cases through the full graph and checks the
orchestrator actually did its job: decomposed into >=2 sub-questions, retrieved
across >=2 distinct sources, and produced a grounded answer with no hallucinated
citations.

Run from the project root after ingesting sample_notes into the default collection:
    python -m citelocal_agent.ingest --path ./sample_notes --reset
    pytest tests/test_orchestrator.py -v
