    - ``trace`` accumulates observability events (one per retrieval / decision).
    - ``retrieved_locators`` accumulates every locator the agent actually
      retrieved this run, so the final answer's citations can be *verified*
      against what was really seen (not just trusted because the LLM emitted them).
    - ``evidence`` accumulates ``{locator, text}`` for each retrieved chunk, so a
      claim can be checked for entailment against the *text* that supports it
      (used by the multi-agent Verifier and per-sentence citation verification).
    - ``sub_results`` accumulates one entry per parallel Researcher in the
      multi-agent path: ``{sub_id, sub_question, answer, citations, evidence}``.
      Researchers write here (not to ``messages``) so N parallel branches merge
      cleanly via ``operator.add`` instead of racing the ``add_messages`` reducer.
    - ``sub_questions`` / ``verified_results`` are single-writer channels (the
      planner / verifier nodes), so they need no reducer.

    The ``operator.add`` channels are append-merged so the whole run is inspectable.
